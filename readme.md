# Google Analytics YouTube Video Tracking
Tracking YouTube Player Events with Google Analytics.

## Event Tracking
All player events are only tracked once, except for video quality events. Restarting the video will not reset the event trackers.

### Default event trackers
* Category: YouTube
* Action:
	* **Started video**: when the video starts playing.
	* **Paused video**: captured if it occurs before 92% of the video has been viewed. This limit is in place because the YouTube player fires a "pause" event immediately before the finish event.
	* **Completed video**: when the video reaches 100% completion.
* Label: URL of embedded video on YouTube.

#####Example
```js
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Started video', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Paused video', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Completed video', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
```
### Progress event trackers

* Category: YouTube
* Action:
	* **25% Progress**: when the video reaches 25% of the total video time.
	* **50% Progress**: when the video reaches 50% of the total video time.
	* **75% Progress**: when the video reaches 75% of the total video time.
* Label: URL of embedded video on YouTube.

#####Example
```js
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Played video: 25%', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Played video: 50%', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Played video: 75%', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
```

### Quality event trackers
The YouTube player fires a "quality" event at the start of the video and subsequent events when the user selects a quality option from the player. YouTube selects the most appropriate playback quality, which will vary for different users, videos, systems and other playback conditions.

* Category: YouTube
* Action:
	* **1080 HD Quality**
	* **720p HD Quality**
	* **480p Quality**
	* **360p Quality**
	* **240p Quality**
* Label: URL of embedded video on YouTube.

#####Example
```js
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Video quality: 1080p HD', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Video quality: 720p HD', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Video quality: 480p', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Video quality: 360p', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'YouTube', 'Video quality: 240p', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk6_hdRtJOE&feature=player_embedded', undefined, true]);
```

### Bounce rate
The event trackers do not impact bounce rate of the page which embeds the video. The value of the opt_noninteraction parameter is set to `true`.


## Usage
Include the scripts in the body section of the HTML document, just before the `</body>` tag. Youâ€™ll need to be running on a web server instead of opening the file directly in your browser. Flash and JS security restrictions will prevent the API from working when run locally.

### Basic
```html
<script src="path/to/youtube.ga.min.js"></script>
<script>
	var configYouTubePlayer = {
		videoID: 'Rk6_hdRtJOE' // The YouTube video ID that identifies the video that the player will load.
	};	
</script>
```	
### With some options
```html
<script src="path/to/youtube.ga.min.js"></script>
<script>
	var configYouTubePlayer = {
		videoID: 'Rk6_hdRtJOE', // The YouTube video ID that identifies the video that the player will load.
		height: 390, // The height of the video player. The default value is 390.
		width: 640, // The width of the video player. The default value is 640.
		trackProgress: true, // Enable progress event tracking.
		trackPlaybackQuality: true // // Enable video quality event tracking.
	};
</script>	
```

Put the following div element inside the body element. The script will replace the div element with an iframe tag.
```html
<div id="ytplayer"></div>
```	
The iframe embeds a YouTube video player and the YouTube iframe API posts content to the iframe tag on your page. This approach allows YouTube to serve an HTML5 player rather than a Flash player for mobile devices that do not support Flash.

## Demo
Demo will be available soon.

## Requirements
* Google Analytics Tracking Code (asynchronous)
* The end user must be using a browser that supports the HTML5 postMessage feature. Most modern browsers support postMessage, though Internet Explorer 7 does not support it.

## Browser Support
Tested in Chrome (21), Firefox (15), Safari (5,6), IE (8,9). Also tested on iOS.
